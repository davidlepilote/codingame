# Coding Game solutions

***SPOILER ALERT*** *These are real, fully functional solutions for the challenges. Please consider _playing the game_ before reading the solution*

This repository is aiming at compiling all solutions of the Coding Game challenges (www.codingame.com). The solutions have the extension name of the programming language they are written with (eg. For Java, the filename is `.java`)

This is a community-oriented repo, and feel free to fork the repo or make pull requests to add new solutions (or improve existing ones)
